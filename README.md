# Mist-Transaction-Failure-Macintosh
I am using a mac laptop operating on version 10.12.6 (macOS Sierra). My Ethereum Mist Wallet is running on version 0.9.2
When trying to send ETH from my main Mist account to the public key for an ETH paper wallet everything runs smoothly. I enter the ETH amount to be sent, set the transaction fee, and enter my password to verify the transaction.
As the transaction processes, the window displays the overall time, the number of confirmations, etc.
The time is displayed as is elapses, but the number of confirmations always stays at 0.
After 5-15 minutes, Mist gives me an error message saying the transaction failed to successfully complete.
Most of message boards on GitHub discuss a similar issue, but for them, although the transaction was said to have failed, actually when through and was displaced on EtherScan. My doesn't go through at all.
I'm not sure what to do.
Thanks!
